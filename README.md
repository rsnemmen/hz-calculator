===========================

Do you want to compute the distance around a star corresponding to a habitable zone?

Enter the stellar effective temperature in Kelvin and the luminosity in solar luminosities. The code computes the habitable zone boundaries in astronomical units. 

# Files included

- `hzcalc.py` is the Python 3x fixed version of the habitable zone calculator developed by [Ravi Kumar Kopparapu](https://personal.ems.psu.edu/~ruk15/planets/) and John Armstrong. 
- `hzinput.py` is the interactive version, demonstrated above.
