Habitable zone calculator
===========================

Do you want to compute the habitable zone boundaries around a star? Here is how:

Input: 

- Stellar effective temperature in Kelvin
- Luminosity in solar luminosities. 

Output: inner and outer radii defining the habitable zone boundaries in astronomical units. 

# Files included

- `hzcalc.py` is the Python 3x fixed version of the habitable zone calculator developed by [Ravi Kumar Kopparapu](https://personal.ems.psu.edu/~ruk15/planets/) and John Armstrong. 
- `hzinput.py` is the interactive version, demonstrated above. 

# Credits

- [Ravi Kumar Kopparapu](https://personal.ems.psu.edu/~ruk15/planets/) developed the original fortran code in April 2014 (cf. references below)
- [John Armstrong](https://www.weber.edu/jcarmstrong) translated to python code in June 2014
- [Rodrigo Nemmen](https://rodrigonemmen.com) made small improvements to the python code on Jan. 2021
